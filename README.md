# FunKeyCleanup

 A short script that removes pre-installed games that come with the FunKey OS.

 ## Instructions

 1. Place the FunKeyCleanup.ps1 file in the base folder for the FunKey

 It should look something like this

 2. Right click this file and select "Run with PowerShell"

 ## Notable Information

 The folders that arer currently being cleaned out are the following:

 - Atari Lynx
 - Game Boy
 - Game Boy Advance
 - Game Boy Color
 - Game Gear
 - Neo Geo Pocket
 - NES
 - PCE-TurboGrafx
 - PS1
 - Sega Genesis
 - Sega Master System
 - SNES
 - WonderSwan

 I left the Native Games folder alone for now as I personally think if either the FunKey Team or DrUm78 start shipping their OSes with any Native Games that it would be cool to keep those. You can always edit the script to include this folder if you so choose.

 I also left alone the other folders as they contain critical or various other info that I think should be left alone imo.
